# MINI-PROJECT-GROUP-3
# SIGN BOARD DETECTION
Sign Board detection is an application that is developing in Android.It’s an app
which we develop for gaving an alert to drivers while driving a vechile.Before
starting the journey by using this application we can know the path between the
source and destination where we wants to travel and also we know how many
left and right turns are there in the path ,also which gives the information from
where we have take turn while travelling.


### Prerequisites

We have to install Google Play Services before we get started working with the google map
Get the API key for getting google map services like Google Map directions,Google Map Routing,Google Map Geolocations

Step 1: Get an API Key from the Google API Console



GET A KEY


Step 2: Add the API key to your application

### Basic Requirements

Android Studio version 2.3.3


Gradle  3.1 Above


Minimum API:API 17(JellyBean)


Maximum API:API 21(Marshmallow)

## Tasks
DISPLAYING A MAP


DRAW ROUTE BETWEEN SOURCE AND DESTINATION


DISPLAY THE DIRECTIONS FROM SOURCE TO DESTINATION


TOKENIZING THE TEXT AND GAVE VOICE ALERT

### Dataset Used

In the case of android for embedding an Googlemap we use Google Maps APIs which is the collection of services that allow you to include maps, geocoding, places, and other content from Google in your applications. By the use of any of the Google Maps APIs is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Google. In order to access the Service, you must have and maintain a Google Account in good standing. You must ensure that any information you give to Google in connection with your Google Account or the Service will always be accurate, correct, and up to date. If there is any contradiction between the Maps APIs Terms and other Maps APIs related documents,then the Maps APIs Terms will take precedence.
We downloaded images for gaving alert whether the turn is sharp or normal turns.
